	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Nearly 1.2 million children with disabilities received federally administered Supplemental Security Income ({SSI}) payments in 2017. Based on a robust review of research and evaluation evidence and microsimulations, The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee identified modifications to {SSI} (ie, increasing the federal {SSI} benefit maximum by one-third or two-thirds) as 1 of 10 strategies that could reduce the {US} child poverty rate, improving child health and well-being on a population level.
{OBJECTIVE}: Describing the availability and amount of {SSI} and State Supplementary Payment ({SSP}) program benefits to support families of children with disabilities may be a first step toward evaluating The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine-proposed modification to {SSI} as a potential poverty alleviation and health improvement tool for children with disabilities and their families.
{DESIGN}: We used public health law research methods to characterize the laws (statutes and state agency regulations) governing the federal {SSI} program and {SSP} programs in the 50 states and District of Columbia from January 1, 1996, through November 1, 2018.
{RESULTS}: The number of jurisdictions offering supplementary payments ({SSP}) was relatively stable between 1996 and 2018. In 2018, 23 {US} jurisdictions legally mandated that {SSP} programs were available for children. Among the states with {SSP} payment amounts in their codified laws, {SSP} monthly benefit amounts ranged from \$8 to \$64.35 in 1996 and \$3.13 to \$60.43 in 2018.
{CONCLUSION}: Our initial exploration of {SSI}-related policies as a tool for improving the economic stability of children with disabilities and their families suggests that current {SSPs}, in combination with {SSI}, would not rise to the level of {SSI} increases proposed by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Understanding more about how {SSI} and {SSP} reach children and work in combination with other federal and state income security programs may help identify policies and strategies that better support children with disabilities in low-income households.},

{METHODS}: {SSI} administrative and U.S. Census Bureau data collected by a multidisciplinary consensus committee convened by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine in 2015 were examined.
{RESULTS}: Less than 1\% of children in 2013 were recipients of {SSI} for mental disabilities. Determination rates ranged from 1,441 to 251 per 100,000 low-income children, an almost sixfold difference. Allowance rates varied from 16\% to 78\%, a fivefold difference. Receipt of benefits ranged from .7\% to 5.3\%, a sevenfold difference.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Large unexplained discrepancies across states were found in review and receipt of {SSI} benefits for low-income children with mental disabilities. Inequities that cannot be explained by disability severity or financial need violate the ethos of equitable access to federally entitled services.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jval.2017.06.013},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Assessment of drug costs for cost-effectiveness analyses ({CEAs}) in the United States is not straightforward because the prices paid for drugs are not publicly available and differ between payers. {CEAs} have relied on list prices that do not reflect the rebates and discounts known to be associated with these purchases.
{OBJECTIVES}: To review available cost measures and propose a novel strategy that is transparent, consistent, and applicable to all {CEAs} taking a {US} health care sector perspective or a societal payer's perspective.
{METHODS}: We propose using the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost ({NADAC}), the Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule ({VAFSS}), and their midpoint as the upper bound, lower bound, and base case, respectively, to estimate net drug prices for various payers. We compare this approach with wholesale acquisition cost ({WAC}), the most common measure observed in our literature review. The minimum {WAC} is used to provide the most conservative comparison.
{RESULTS}: Our sample consists of 1436 brand drugs and 1599 generic drugs. On average, the upper bound ({NADAC}) is 1\% and 9.8\% lower than the {WAC} for brand and generic drugs respectively, whereas the lower bound ({VAFSS}) is 48.3\% and 54.2\% lower than the {WAC}. The {NADAC} is less than the {WAC} in 89.6\% of drug groups. The distributions of these relationships do not show a clear mode and have wide variation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study suggests that the {WAC} may be an overestimate for the base case because the minimum {WAC} is higher than the {NADAC} for most drugs. Our approach balances uncertainty and lack of data for the cost of pharmaceuticals with the need for a transparent and consistent approach for valid {CEAs}.},

	abstract = {This article simulates eligibility for Supplemental Security Income ({SSI}) among the elderly, analyzes factors affecting participation, and looks at the potential effects of various options to modify financial eligibility standards for the federal {SSI} program. We find that in the estimated noninstitutional elderly population of 30.2 million in the United States in 1991, approximately 2 million individuals aged 65 or older were eligible for {SSI} (a 6.6 percent rate of eligibility). Our overall estimate of the rate of participation among eligible elderly is approximately 63 percent, suggesting that more than a third of those who are eligible do not participate in the program. The results of our analysis of factors affecting participation among the eligible elderly show that expected {SSI} benefits and a number of demographic and socioeconomic variables are associated with the probability of participation. We also simulate the effects of various policy options on the poverty rate, poverty gap, annual program cost, the number of participants, and the average estimated benefits among participants. The simulations consider the potential effects of five policy alternatives: Increase the general income exclusion ({GIE}) from \$20 to \$80. Increase the earned income exclusion ({EIE}) from \$65 to \$260. Increase the federal benefit rate ({FBR}) by \$50 for individuals and \$75 for couples and eliminate the {GIE}. Increase the asset threshold to \$3,000 for individuals and \$4,500 for couples. Increase the asset threshold to \$6,000 for individuals and \$9,000 for couples. Using 1991 microdata from the Survey of Income and Program Participation ({SIPP}) matched to Social Security Administration administrative records and making adjustments reflecting aggregate program statistics, we present the results of our simulations for December 1999. The results show substantial variation in the simulated effects of the five policy alternatives along the various outcome dimensions considered. The simulated effects on the poverty gap of the elderly population range from a 7.9 percent reduction ("Increase the {GIE} from \$20 to \$80") to a 0.1 percent reduction ("Increase the {EIE} from \$65 to \$260"). All simulated interventions are expected to increase the rate of {SSI} participation among the elderly from a high of 20.3 percent ("Increase the {GIE} from \$20 to \$80") to a low of 0.5 percent ("Increase the {EIE} from \$65 to \$260"). We also find that the interventions that have greater estimated effects in terms of increased participation and reduced poverty tend to cost more. At the high end, we estimate that increasing the {GIE} from \$20 to \$80 could raise annual federal {SSI} cash benefit outlays by about 46 percent, compared with only 0.9 percent for increasing the {EIE} from \$65 to \$260. Similar to the {EIE} intervention, raising the resource thresholds by 50 percent would reduce the overall poverty gap of the elderly by only 0.2 percent, would increase {SSI} participation only modestly (by 1.3 percent), but would entail slightly higher program costs (by 1.4 percent). Increasing the asset threshold by 200 percent would have higher estimated effects on all three outcomes, but it would still be associated with relatively low increases in both costs and benefits. Finally, the simulated effects on the three key outcomes of increasing the {FBR} by \$50 for individuals and \$75 for couples, combined with eliminating the {GIE}, are relatively large but are clearly less substantial than increasing the {GIE} from \$20 to \$80. This work relies on data from the {SIPP} matched to administrative data on federal {SSI} benefits that provide a more accurate picture of {SSI} participation than has been feasible for previous studies. We simulate eligibility for federal {SSI} benefits by applying the program rules to detailed information on the characteristics of individuals and couples based on the rich array of demographic and socioeconomic data in the {SIPP}, particularly the comprehensive information {SIPP} provides on assets and monthly income. A probit model is estimated to analyze factors affecting participation among the eligible elderly. Finally, we conduct the policy simulations using altered program rules represented by the policy alternatives and predicted participation probabilities to estimate outcomes under simulated program rules. We compare those simulated outcomes to observed outcomes under current program rules. The results of our simulations are conditional on the characteristics of participants and eligibles in 1991, but they also reflect aggregate adjustments capturing substantial changes in overall participation and program benefit levels between 1991 and 1999.},

The model is estimated using household survey information exact-matched to {SSA} records on disability adjudications from 1989 to 1993. Under program provisions, different criteria dictate outcomes at different steps of the determination process. We find that, without the multistaged structural approach, effects of many important health, disability, and vocational factors are not readily discernible. As a result, split-sample predictions of overall allowance rates from the sequential model perform considerably better than do those for the conventional allowed/denied logit regression.},

	abstract = {In the post-1996 welfare reform period in the U.S., disability assistance has become a significant source of government aid for low-income residents as other forms of public support have faced considerable reductions and restrictions. In order to qualify for Supplemental Security Income ({SSI}) - a means-tested assistance program that provides income stipends to qualified residents - working-age individuals with disabilities must have little income and resources, and procure medical documentation that confirms that they are unable to work due to a disability. The result of rising {SSI} enrollment in the face of cutbacks to other government programs is the increasing medicalization of welfare, whereby receipt of welfare benefits is contingent on a medical diagnosis of disability. Using county-level data from the American Community Survey and the Social Security Administration, this paper examines the changing spatial patterns of {SSI} participation of the working-age population in 2000 and 2010 across the U.S. in addition to the interconnections between disability, welfare, and poverty. Results from spatial analyses illustrate geographic variation in {SSI} prevalence, with distinctive spatial clusters of higher than average {SSI} participation in the southeast and Appalachian regions of the U.S. and in northern California. Multiple linear regression model results reveal that {SSI} participation is significantly correlated with disability, poverty, race, family type, and level of education in both 2000 and 2010. The findings suggest that spatial concentrations of disability, poverty, and underemployment persist in largely rural areas. The discussion explores the potential social and economic implications of long-term {SSI} clustering on localities and residents, and points to future research directions.},

Children's public health insurance eligibility increased dramatically during the late 1990s with the launch of the Children's Health Insurance Program along with concurrent Medicaid expansions. We use a measure of simulated eligibility as an exogenous source of variation in Medicaid generosity to identify the effects of the eligibility expansions on {SSI} outcomes. Though increases in eligibility for public health insurance did not affect contemporaneous youth {SSI} applications or awards on average, expansions in coverage significantly decreased both applications and awards in states where {SSI} recipients did not automatically receive Medicaid. We attribute the difference in findings to the higher transactions costs associated with entering Medicaid via {SSI} in such states. In the long-term, increased public insurance eligibility during childhood reduces young adult {SSI} applications to some extent, consistent with recent findings that Medicaid coverage in youth improves adult health and economic outcomes.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To compare insurance coverage, access to care, and unmet health needs of children with and without chronic conditions in a national probability sample of the {US} population and to examine the role of poverty status in any demonstrated differences between the 2 groups.
{DESIGN}: We analyzed parent-report data on children 0-17 years old from the 1994 National Health Interview Survey Disability Supplement ({NHIS}-D) and from the health insurance and access to care files of the 1994 Family Resources Supplement to the {NHIS}. In the {NHIS}-D, 4452 (14.8\%) of the 30032 children were identified as having a chronic condition by a noncategorical method. We compared insurance coverage, access to care, and unmet needs of children with and without conditions overall and also compared them within 3 different income levels relative to the national poverty index: 1) below, 2) within 100\%-200\%, and 3) {\textgreater}200\% above poverty level.
{RESULTS}: In bivariate analyses, children with chronic conditions were more likely to be covered by some type of health insurance (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.3) and to have a usual provider both for medical ("sick") care ({OR}, 1.4) and for routine or preventive care ({OR}, 1.4). They also were more likely to have the same provider for medical care and routine or preventive care ({OR}, 1.2) and to have seen their health care provider in the last year ({OR}, 1.8) than children without chronic conditions (all P {\textless}.0001). Nonetheless, children with chronic conditions were twice as likely to have had at least 1 unmet need from a list of 4 services that included dental care, prescription medications, eyeglasses, and mental health services ({OR}, 2.0). They also were more likely to have more than 1 unmet need from the list ({OR}, 3.1), to have been unable to get needed medical care ({OR}, 3.1), and to have delayed obtaining medical care because of worry about its cost ({OR}, 1.8). Children with chronic conditions were at greater risk for unmet needs than were children without conditions across all income levels. The magnitude of the disparity between the groups increased with family income level. Differences persisted even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and insurance status.
{CONCLUSION}: Despite higher levels of insurance coverage and greater access to regular providers of medical and routine care compared with healthy peers, children with chronic conditions are reported by their parents to be less likely than other children to receive the full range of needed health services. The magnitudes of the differences are small, yet the pattern of disadvantage in meeting health care needs among children with conditions compared with healthy peers is consistent across many different variables and it exists across income levels.},
